  <meta property="og:description" content="U.S. oil and gas companies have burned off at least 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over much of the last decade, while unknown amounts of the methane-rich gas have flowed directly into the atmosphere. Regulators are largely in the dark about these volumes, even as they try to slow the pace of global warming. But advances in satellite data reveal the true extent of these greenhouse gases.">

              <p>Just off of West Broadway Road and South Country Club Drive is Paz de Cristo, a gated complex with scattered groups of people. They are there for similar reasons, looking for the basic necessities: food, clothes, water and hygiene.</p>

              <p>Among those people is Byron Paladin, a homeless man who volunteers at Paz de Cristo and St. Vincent de Paul in Mesa. Byron said societal misconceptions about homeless people reinforce the negative treatment they face from others.</p>

              <p>Byron said people do not view him as homeless; he doesn’t fit the stereotype of “the lazy, drug-using person living on the streets,” he said.</p>

              <p>Byron looks like any other average older man: His facial hair is well-kept, he always sports a backward baseball cap, and his clothes are clean and never wrinkled.</p>

              <p>There is no definition of what it means to be homeless or who a homeless person is, he said, and the stigma surrounding the community comes from lack of knowledge and understanding.</p>

              <p>To break this, more homeless people must tell their stories and share their experiences — and others have to listen, Byron said.</p>

              <p>“That’s where people are gonna start learning that ‘Oh, my God, these are real human lives,’” he said.</p>

              <p>These are the stories of people who are homeless and those who work to advocate for them.</p>

              <h3>Byron</h3>

              <p>Byron found himself without a home after an eviction notice was pasted on his door.</p>

              <p>“I went on vacation, left all my stuff in an apartment, came back, the apartment was emptied,” he said. “So, I spent a couple of months on the streets there.”</p>

              <p>Byron, 62, has lived in Arizona, New Mexico and Massachusetts, and during his time in each state, he has learned to expect the unexpected.</p>

              <p>“Life is an ongoing process of learning, and to learn, you have to have challenge,” he said. “Don’t be afraid of the challenges no matter how far they are, how strong they are. The hard part is getting people to accept those challenges and say, ‘OK, I can do this. I am worthy.’”</p>

              <p>In the over 30 years Byron has been homeless, he has had life-changing opportunities. In 1992, he started “Spare Change News,” a newspaper written and distributed by homeless people, and he has given lectures at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

              <p>But Byron’s life has not always been full of success. He has faced challenges, such as losing his editor position with the paper and witnessing others’ trauma within the homeless community.</p>

              <p>But with each of these experiences came about growth.</p>

              <p>Byron learned how to adapt to each situation and environment he was in and did so with humility and dignity.</p>

              <p>“The biggest thing is the one thing that I’ve always never lost is self respect. That gives me my dignity,” he explained. “Nobody has ever been able to take that away. No one ever will.”</p>

              <p>It didn’t matter where Byron was since he would find his way; he knew the way of “the streets” and how to make due with what he had. Byron knows everything happens for a reason and that reason is to help him become a better person in the end.</p>

              <p>“You may make a mistake here or there, everybody does,” he said. “But regardless of what happens … I’m here for a reason … Everybody is here for a reason. We all have something to learn.”</p>

              <p>The biggest lesson Byron has learned is that no one is immune to homelessness and that we all deserve the chance to share our stories.</p>

              <p>Byron continues to live life to the fullest. He surrounds himself with people he loves and does what he can to the best of his abilities.</p>

              <h3>Carol</h3>

              <p>Carol Reed, 63, said she learned to love and care for people from her mother. This led her to want to work with unsheltered people, looking for that “love of family.”</p>

              <p>“I love people and I care for people,” she explained. “I always wonder, ‘look at the big picture.’”</p>

              <p>Carol, Paz de Cristo’s empowerment program manager, seeks to learn more about those who come to Paz to find out who they truly are. Carol wants to know about their families and their parents, and she doesn’t see them as just looking for a meal.</p>

              <p>She blames the “mother figure” in her, but Carol will do whatever she can to provide for them as if they are her family – she already lovingly refers to them as such.</p>

              <p>“These are my children … even though I have my grown family,” she said. “I’ve had to get on a few of them just like I would kids, but they always come back.</p>

              <p>The tough love she dishes out is because she sees so much potential in those who come to Paz and St. Vincent. Carol recalled several times when people came to update her on their current situation or seek advice or help.</p>

              <p>Just recently, a man came to tell Carol how he found stable housing, employment and was on the right track.</p>

              <p>“I just threw my hands up in the air and I said, ‘Thank you Jesus for everything that has happened to this man,” she explained. “He kept hugging me and saying, ‘I’m so glad I seen you, I’m happy.’”</p>

              <p>Even though all who come through Paz do not reach this point, people’s successes and growth remind Carol of the important role she plays in helping others.</p>

              <p>“Just seeing those things gives me the energy, because one out of 10 is probably going to be a change,” she said.</p>

              <p>Carol has learned that listening and talking can be enough to make a difference and provide people a safe space to go deeper and share their stories.</p>

              <p>Another thing Carol has learned is that homelessness doesn’t discriminate based on economic status, nationality, education level or background —  “It can happen to anybody in a heartbeat.”</p>

              <p>Working at Paz is an emotionally challenging job. Just recently, she had to provide a death certificate to a houseless widower. She sometimes has to take days off of work to take time for herself, but Carol continues to come back.</p>

              <p>“I’m not Jenny from the Block, I’m Carol from Broadway,” she said.</p>

              <h3>From Boston, In Print: How ‘Spare Change News’ Came to Be</h3>

              <p>Byron Paladin says he has lived a full life and he has done the right thing when the time called for it. One of those things was starting “Spare Change News” in 1992 when he was “on the streets” in Boston. The paper changed his attitude toward life and taught him the importance of storytelling for education.</p>
